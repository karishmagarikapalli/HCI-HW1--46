## Issues

* One of the buttons in the elevator does not have a label
* The buttons upon being clicked do not give any form of feedback to the user
* There are no buttons to call for help or to alert the authorities in case of emergency
* The elevator is dark inside with no ventilation


## Why is the current design bad?

* A person using the elevator for the first time will not be able to navigate through all floors due to poor labelling
* A person using the elevator for the first time will not understand if or not the button was pressed due to no feedback
* In case of emergencies a person will not be able to call for help
* People may feel claustrophobic due to poor ventilation and lack of lights and fans


# Grade B


## Common Uses

* Going up and down a building
* Helping disabled people access floors
* Moving objects across floors


## Rare Uses

* Call for help in case of emergencies


## Sequence of actions

* Call for lift
* When doors open enter
* Click for the floor you want to get to
* Wait for you to reach 
* When the lift arrives it will give out a signal
* Open doors
* Go out of the lift


## How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?

* A display to show which floor the lift is on 
* A display to show the direction in which the lif is moving
* Buttons labels show what a button does


## Feedback

* When a button is pressed there should be a light that tells the user that the button has been pressed
* When a floor is reached display should announce that


## Mistakes with the design

* There are no buttons for alarm, call for help, door open and door close
* There is only one button to call the lift
* No feedback to the user
* No proper labelling


## Improvements

* Feedback
* Buttons for emergencies (call, alarm and cancel) and utilities (fan and light, door open and close)
