## Issues

* One of the buttons in the elevator does not have a label
* The buttons upon being clicked do not give any form of feedback to the user
* There are no buttons to call for help or to alert the authorities in case of emergency
* The elevator is dark inside with no ventilation


## Why is the current design bad?

* A person using the elevator for the first time will not be able to navigate through all floors due to poor labelling
* A person using the elevator for the first time will not understand if or not the button was pressed due to no feedback
* In case of emergencies a person will not be able to call for help
* People may feel claustrophobic due to poor ventilation and lack of lights and fans


# Grade B


## Common Uses

## Sequence of actions
